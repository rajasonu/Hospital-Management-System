        <td colspan="4"><p dir="ltr">HMS was introduced to solve the complications coming from managing all the paper works of every patient associated with the various departments of hospitalization with confidentiality. HMS provides the ability to manage all the paperwork in one place, reducing the work of staff in arranging and analyzing the paperwork of the patients. HMS does many works like:</p>
          <ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Maintain the medical records of the patient &nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li dir="ltr">
              <p dir="ltr">Maintain the contact details of the patient</p>
            </li>
            <li dir="ltr">
              <p dir="ltr">Keep track of the appointment dates</p>
            </li>
            <li dir="ltr">
              <p dir="ltr">Save the insurance information for later reference</p>
            </li>
            <li dir="ltr">
              <p dir="ltr">Tracking the bill payments.</p>

	      <p>The IT system has revolutionised the field of medicine. In this fast-paced world&nbsp;of medicine, it is a daunting task to manage a multi-speciality hospital.&nbsp;A hospital management system (HMS) is a computer or web based system that&nbsp;facilitates managing the functioning of the hospital or any medical set up1. This&nbsp;system or software will help in making the whole functioning paperless. It&nbsp;integrates all the information regarding patients, doctors, staff, hospital&nbsp;administrative details etc. into one software4. It has sections for various&nbsp;professionals that make up a hospital.</p>
	      <h3>Doctors</h3>
	      <p>This section includes the list of the doctors and their&nbsp;schedules3. It also includes doctors&rsquo; emergency numbers. The doctor can&nbsp;check his schedule and that of other doctors too. This helps a doctor to&nbsp;edit his schedule accordingly. It includes list of the available medicines&nbsp;for specific diseases so that the doctor can easily look for an alternative&nbsp;when in need. The patient can be given an appointment referring to the&nbsp;doctors&rsquo; schedule. The use of HMS makes the co-ordination between a doctor and patient easy and hassle free.</p>
	      <h3>Patient information</h3>
	      <p>New patients can be registered in the system. An&nbsp;electronic medical record system is in-built which stores all the basic and&nbsp;medical details of the patient2. One can also add a feature to store&nbsp;photos of the patients as identity proof which can also help in medico-legal cases of false identities or fraud1.</p>
